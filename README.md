**Hey, how are you?**

Are you scrolling alone inside your room
Is your heart good
Or did something go and break it
In the words of Carl Sagan
"We're all just stars and bacon"
That's not quite what he said, but it's true

Hey, you're still here
Are you like me
On this repo so you can be
Lost and numb
In a warm bath made of *content*:
- **R3TROterminal** — just what it says... I simple pranky oldie terminal simulator.
- **yourMission** — a mission impossible fan made online shrine.

Hey, are you alright
Are you scrolling alone again tonight
You'll be fine
Even if your heart is breaking
You've got me and Carl Sagan
And his famous postulation
But if we're all alone in space
It'd be an awful waste
So I'm just signing in to say
How are you
